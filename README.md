# Student-Management-System

## Problem Statement
Due to the development seen over the years, many Institutes have been made and its spread across all
over the country.
These Institutes have large number of students and itâ€™s a hassle to keep track of each one of them
manually in a notebook.
And Hence, such codes can be used for reference and are modified and used in such Institutes for
keeping track of Student details.
This is a much more feasible way for the Institution.
This is called the Student Record Management System.
