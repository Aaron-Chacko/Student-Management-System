# Student-Management-System

## Problem Statement
Due to the development seen over the years, many Institutes have been made and its spread across all
over the country.
These Institutes have large numbers of students and it’s a hassle to keep track of each one of them
manually in a notebook.
Hence, such codes can be used for reference and are modified and used in such Institutes for
keeping track of Student details.
This is a much more feasible way for the Institution.
This is called the Student Record Management System.

## Methodology
### Define Student Class:
• Create a Student class with attributes such as student_id, name, and a dictionary to store
courses and corresponding grades.
### Add Student:
• Create a method to add a new student to the system.
• Check if the student ID already exists to avoid duplicates.
• If not, add a new Student object to the system.
### Add Course and Grade:
• Create a method to add a course and its grade for a specific student.
• Check if the student ID exists in the system.
• If yes, add the course and grade to the student's record.
### Display Student Information:
• Create a method to display all information about a particular student, including their ID,
name, courses, grades, and GPA.
### Student Management System Class:
• Create a StudentManagementSystem class to manage all students.
• Maintain a dictionary to store students using their IDs as keys.
### Example Usage:
• Create an instance of StudentManagementSystem.
• Add students, courses, and grades using the methods provided by the system.
### User Interface (Optional):
• If you want a user interface, you can use a graphical library (e.g., Tkinter) or a web
framework (e.g., Flask) to interact with the system.
### File Handling (Optional):
• Implement file handling to save and load student information from a file (e.g., CSV or JSON)
for persistent data storage.
### Additional Features (Optional):
• Depending on your requirements, you can add features like updating student information,
searching for students, and generating reports

## Modules of the proposed work
1.student.py
• Add Students
• Delete Students
• Update Students
• Display student's details
2. fees.py
• Payment Details
• Pending Fees
• Total fees
• Fee details for each student.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the need for a centralized system that seamlessly manages student data, academic
records, and administrative tasks. This concludes that an integrated system
can improve administrative efficiency, enhance communication, and provide timely access to
important information.
